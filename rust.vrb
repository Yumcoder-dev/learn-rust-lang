\frametitle{Improving Our I/O Project, removing clone Using Iterator(4)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We can write this code in a more concise way using iterator adaptor methods. Doing so also lets us avoid having a \textbf{mutable intermediate results vector}. The functional programming style prefers to minimize the amount of mutable state to make code clearer. \textbf{Removing the mutable state might enable a future enhancement to make searching happen in parallel}, because we wouldnâ€™t have to manage concurrent access to the results vector.
		\item 	To determine whether to use loops or iterators, you need to know which implementation is faster: \textbf{The iterator version was slightly faster! }(for more info see \href{https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-04-performance.html}{here}).
